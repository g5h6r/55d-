<h1>Gas Station Simulator Script - Farming GUI</h1>

The release of scripts for the popular Roblox mode *Gas Station Simulator* has introduced new features, including the highly anticipated Autofarm function, which streamlines gameplay by automating tasks. Developers caution players to avoid rapid button inputs, enforcing a 30-second cooldown between clicks to prevent being kicked from the game. Within the mode, users can explore diverse roles—from chef and builder to gas station owner—while managing a virtual fuel business on a vibrant, visually engaging map. Originally launched in October 2018 by *Just For Fun*, the game has grown into a staple in Roblox’s business simulation genre, mirroring real-world entrepreneurial challenges. Its blend of strategy and creativity has drawn praise from players and content creators alike, cementing its reputation as a dynamic tycoon-style experience that balances economic management with immersive role-playing.
